We also implemented a simulated sensor on Wokwi based on the ESP32 micro-controller in MicroPython. Below is the link to the project:

This folder contains the files in the Wokwi project for archival purpose. If we were to have a real ESP32 device and other necessary hardwares, the files in this folder can be directly used to run the sensor.
